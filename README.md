# README

## Notes:
These are notes I wrote, used, and shared with people I have taught python to. Originally I was helping my coworkers 
learn and/or improve at using python. I taught for roughly 12 weeks with 8 different sets of lecture styles and 
four of me helping them write code or just answer questions. There were additional meetings scheduled as needed, to
help with "homework" that was assigned, or just for giving more one on one help and interactive lessons. 

After a while some people I know outside of work expressed interest in learning python for their careers. I took the 
notes that I made at Gap and redisigned them for my acquantences. I have changed all of the variable names and data so
that there is nothing owned by Gap in them. Instead video game data was used for the purposes of lectures as well as
interactive lessons and projects. 

## Data:
There are two datasets, they come from different source but are joinable. 

The first is Steam sales. This is sourced from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales?resource=download

The second is Steam player data. This is sourced from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackogozaly/steam-player-data


I do not own either of these datasets nor do I claim any of the work in scraping them together. There is a very basic
data dictionary file for the first dataset in the data folder. Both have better documentation and description on their
Kaggle links. 


## Notebook:
With his permission I have included a notebook that was used for a while by a friend of mine while I taught him. 
It was where we had lectures and interactive learning/coding. 
This file will have some notes, code from lessons, code from homework, and code from his own personal drive to learn. 

## Images:
This is a copy of all the images that are used in the teaching notebooks.
